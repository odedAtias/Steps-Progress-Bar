With its customizable styles and smooth animation, it provides a seamless user experience and enhances the visual appeal of any web page.

## Implementation Remarks

1️⃣ The Main function of this project is updateDom, and this function handles the updating of the progress bar and active circles. 
This function iterates through each circle and adds or removes the 'active' class based on the current step. It then calculates the percentage of steps completed, updating the width of the progress bar accordingly.

2️⃣ I added event listeners to the next and the previous buttons, which update the current step and re-render the progress bar using the updateDom function. The prev button is disabled when the user is on the first step, while the next button is disabled when the user is on the last step.
